> **Strategic Plan for Building the Developer-First CMS**

*Last Updated: December 6, 2025*

---

## 🎯 Current State

### ✅ What's Built (Phase 1: Foundation)

- [x] **Backend Server** (Express + WebSocket)
  - REST API for content management
  - File-based content store with Chokidar watching
  - Source mapping with Babel AST parsing
  - Real-time WebSocket synchronization

- [x] **Frontend Editor**
  - Split-view editor with live preview
  - Responsive viewport controls (mobile/tablet/desktop)
  - Content editing interface
  - Debug console for system monitoring

- [x] **Developer Experience**
  - `data-editable` attribute system
  - JSON content files
  - Hot reload on file changes
  - Documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, MANIFESTO)

### 📊 Current Metrics
- **15 files** in codebase
- **~1,400 lines** of code
- **0 dependencies** on proprietary services
- **100% open source**

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Next 2 Weeks)

### Priority 1: Core Stability

#### 1.1 Error Handling & Validation
**Why**: Currently, invalid JSON or missing files can crash the server  
**Impact**: Production-ready stability

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add JSON schema validation for content files
- [ ] Graceful error handling in `ContentStore`
- [ ] Validate `data-editable` attribute uniqueness
- [ ] Add error boundaries in React components
- [ ] Better WebSocket reconnection logic
- [ ] API error responses with proper status codes

**Files to modify:**
- `server/contentStore.js` - Add try/catch and validation
- `server/index.js` - Middleware for error handling
- `client/App.jsx` - Error boundaries
- `server/websocket.js` - Reconnection logic

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days

---

#### 1.2 Testing Infrastructure
**Why**: No tests = fragile codebase  
**Impact**: Confidence in changes, easier contributions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Jest for backend testing
- [ ] Set up Vitest for frontend testing
- [ ] Write tests for `ContentStore` CRUD operations
- [ ] Write tests for `SourceMapper` AST parsing
- [ ] Write tests for WebSocket message handling
- [ ] Write tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow

**New files to create:**
- `server/__tests__/contentStore.test.js`
- `server/__tests__/sourceMap.test.js`
- `server/__tests__/api.test.js`
- `client/__tests__/SplitViewEditor.test.jsx`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 days

---

#### 1.3 Configuration Management
**Why**: Hard-coded ports and paths make deployment difficult  
**Impact**: Easier deployment, multi-environment support

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `.env.example` file
- [ ] Add `dotenv` for environment variables
- [ ] Configurable ports (API, WebSocket, Vite)
- [ ] Configurable content directory path
- [ ] Configurable component paths for source mapping
- [ ] Environment-specific configs (dev/staging/prod)

**New files:**
```
.env.example
config/
  ├── default.js
  ├── development.js
  ├── production.js
  └── index.js
```

**Estimated Time:** 2 days

---

### Priority 2: Developer Experience

#### 2.1 CLI Tool
**Why**: Manual setup is tedious  
**Impact**: Faster onboarding, better first impression

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `nodelx init` command
- [ ] Auto-generate config files
- [ ] Interactive setup wizard
- [ ] Template selection (React, Next.js, Vite)
- [ ] Automatic `data-editable` detection in existing projects
- [ ] `nodelx dev` command to start both servers

**New files:**
```
cli/
  ├── index.js
  ├── commands/
  │   ├── init.js
  │   ├── dev.js
  │   └── generate.js
  └── templates/
      ├── react/
      ├── nextjs/
      └── vite/
```

**Package.json changes:**
```json
{
  "bin": {
    "nodelx": "./cli/index.js"
  }
}
```

**Estimated Time:** 5-6 days

---

#### 2.2 Better Documentation
**Why**: Developers need clear examples and guides  
**Impact**: More adoption, fewer support questions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Create `INSTALLATION.md` with step-by-step guide
- [ ] Create `API_REFERENCE.md` for backend endpoints

**Estimated Time:** 3 days

---

## 🎨 Phase 2: Visual Editing (Next 4-6 Weeks)

### 2.1 Click-to-Edit on Preview
**Why**: Most intuitive editing experience  
**Impact**: Game-changer for client UX

**How it works:**
1. User clicks element in preview iframe
2. Iframe posts message to parent with element's `data-editable` ID
3. Editor highlights corresponding field in left panel
4. User edits in place or in sidebar

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Inject click handler script into preview iframe
- [ ] Implement `postMessage` communication
- [ ] Highlight selected element with outline
- [ ] Show tooltip with field name on hover
- [ ] Open edit modal on click
- [ ] Inline editing for text content
- [ ] Image picker modal for images

**New files:**
```
client/editor/
  ├── ClickToEdit.jsx
  ├── InlineEditor.jsx
  ├── ImagePicker.jsx
  └── inject-script.js
```

**Estimated Time:** 10-12 days

---

### 2.2 Rich Content Editor
**Why**: Clients need formatting options  
**Impact**: Professional content editing

**Tasks:**

- [ ] CDN integration prep (local storage first)

**New files:**
```
server/
  ├── uploads.js
  └── imageProcessor.js
public/
  └── uploads/ (git-ignored)
client/components/
  └── ImageUploader.jsx
```

**Libraries:**
- `multer` - File uploads
- `sharp` - Image processing
- `react-image-crop` - Cropping UI

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 days

---

## 🗂️ Phase 3: Content Management (8-10 Weeks)

    "cta": { "type": "text", "default": "Learn More" }
  }
}
```

**Estimated Time:** 7-8 days

---

### 3.3 Draft/Publish Workflow

- Consider `Y.js` for collaborative editing

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 days (complex)

---

## 🎯 Phase 5: Production Ready (16-20 Weeks)

### 5.1 Database Integration
**Why**: JSON files don't scale to production  
**Impact**: True production readiness

**Database choices:**
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** - Recommended
- **MongoDB** - Document-based alternative

CREATE TABLE pages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  page_id VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  content JSONB,
  status VARCHAR,
  published_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  role VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- versions table
CREATE TABLE versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  page_id UUID REFERENCES pages(id),
  content JSONB,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Estimated Time:** 12-15 days

- [ ] Generate multiple sizes (thumbnail, medium, large)
- [ ] Lazy loading images
- [ ] Automatic format conversion (WebP)
- [ ] Image metadata extraction (dimensions, size)
- [ ] Bulk image migration tool

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 days

---

### 5.3 Performance Optimization
**Why**: Speed matters for UX  
**Impact**: Professional-grade performance

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer

## 🎯 Decision Framework

When prioritizing features, ask:

1. **Does this align with the manifesto?**
   - ✅ Yes → Consider it
   - ❌ No → Reject it

2. **Does this benefit developers or clients?**
   - Developers → Priority
   - Clients → Secondary
   - Both → High priority

3. **Is this core functionality or nice-to-have?**
   - Core → Do now
   - Nice-to-have → Backlog

4. **Can this be a plugin instead?**
   - Yes → Make pluggable
   - No → Build into core

5. **Would removing this make NodeLx less "NodeLx"?**
   - Yes → Keep it
   - No → Consider removing

---

## 🚀 Let's Build

**Next commit should include:**
1. Error handling improvements
2. Test setup
3. Configuration management
4. Updated documentation

**Target:** Ship these improvements by end of next week.
